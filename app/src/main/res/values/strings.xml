    <!-- card descriptions -->
    <string name="defects_description">Defective beans are cacao beans that are mouldy, insect-infested, slaty, and germinated. If a bean presents two or more defects, the defect that counts as the worse condition is the one that appears first in the list. The list is in descending order of importance; with mouldy having the highest importance and germinated having the lowest importance. </string>
    <string name="mouldy_description">Mold present on parts of the cacao bean which is visible to the naked eye.</string>
    <string name="germinated_description">Shell of the cacao which have been pierced, slit or broken by a growth of the seed germ or presence of radicle.</string>
    <string name="insect_description">Cacao bean of which its parts are found to contain insects or have been damaged by insects.</string>
    <string name="slate_description">Cacao bean which is unfissured and shows a purple-gray color on half or more of the surface.</string>

    <string name="color_description">Cacao beans which has undergone fermentation process of which the cotyledons are fissured with color ranging from brown, partly purple, total purple, and very dark brown.</string>
    <string name="color_brown_description">Cacao beans that have light to dark brown coloration. These cacao beans are fully fermented and used to make high-quality cacao products.</string>
    <string name="color_partlypurple_description">Cacao beans that has a mix of purple and brown coloration. These cacao beans are likely not fully ripe or mature.</string>
    <string name="color_totalpurple_description">Total purple beans are cacao beans that has a fully purple coloration. These cacao beans are not ripe or mature. </string>
    <string name="color_verydarkbrown_description">Cacao beans that has a very dark brown or black coloration on its surface. These cacao beans are likely overfermented or fermented for too long. </string>

    <string name="fissuring_description">Fissuring is characterized by the opening up of large splits or rifts within the beans\' internal structure. Beans that are heavily fissured are generally more fermented than beans that have a cheesy or slate appearance when cut. </string>
    <string name="g1_description">Cacao beans with grade 1 fissuring are fully fermented cacao beans. Almost all of its surface is heavily fissured or has small branch-like lines. </string>
    <string name="g2_description">Cacao beans with grade 2 fissuring are partially fermented cacao beans. Fissures have formed on its surface but is still smooth in some areas. </string>
    <string name="g3_description">Cacao beans with grade 3 fissuring are slightly fermented cacao beans. It is lightly fissured or has a few branch-like lines on its surface. </string>
    <string name="g4_description">Cacao beans with grade 4 fissuring are unfermented and is characterized with a cut bean surface that is relatively smooth. </string>

    <string name="beancutting_description">Bean cutting is an important step in the process of evaluating the quality of cacao beans, and it must be done properly to ensure that all beans are cut cleanly and accurately. If the cutting is not done correctly, there is a risk of missing some beans, which can affect the accuracy of the evaluation and the quality of the final product.</string>
    <string name="step1_description">Cacao beans should be carefully oriented with the cutting bed chamber. The long side of the bean should be lined up with the long side of the cutting bed. </string>
    <string name="step2_description">After filling all the guillotine chambers with 50 cacao beans, carefully close the cacao bean guillotine. </string>
    <string name="step3_description">Lock the cacao bean guillotine using the latch engaged by finger tightening and the top lock. This ensures to just hold the cutter closed when the guillotine is used.</string>
    <string name="step4_description">Place the cacao bean guillotine on its two feet on the floor or low table and the blade is inserted to begin cutting.</string>
    <string name="step5_description">Apply even pressure on the blade for a smooth and even cut and lower it down until it comes to a stop with the handle on the top of the cutting block.</string>
    <string name="step6_description">Lay the cacao bean guillotine on a flat table and undo the top lock and latch opening. </string>
